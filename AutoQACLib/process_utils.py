    Runs a subprocess command with real-time output streaming and optional timeout handling.

    This function starts an external process and streams its output, both standard output and

    to handle each line of the output dynamically. It also provides support for timeout to

            returned at the end.
        timeout (int | None): The maximum time in seconds to allow the command to execute.
            If the timeout expires, the process is forcefully killed. If None, no timeout is
            applied.
        working_dir (str | Path | None): The directory in which to execute the command.

            If None on Windows, a default optimized configuration is used.

              is reached.
